There is significant momentum in driving the adoption of R packages in the life sciences industries, in particular, the RConsortium Submissions Working Group is dedicated to promoting the use of R for regulatory submissions to the FDA. 

The RConsortium Submissions Working Group successfully completed an R-based submission in November 2021 through the eCTD portal (R Submissions Pilot 1). This Pilot was completed on [March 10, 2022](https://github.com/RConsortium/submissions-wg/blob/main/_Documents/Summary_R_Pilot_Submission2.pdf) after a successful statistical review and evaluation by the FDA staff.

## Reproducing the R Submission Pilot 2 Shiny App using Rhino

While the original Shiny application submitted to the FDA was wrapped using {Golem}, we replicated the application using our in-house developed framework [Rhino](https://appsilon.github.io/rhino/). The main motivation was to provide an example of an R Submission that is not an R package and to identify and solve any issues that may arise from this approach.
